Tasks:
1. Create a spring-boot web application named “hello-world” that has a welcome page showing
“Welcome LOLC” when accessed with below path http://localhost:8080/hello-world/welcome
2. Setup minikube on your local machine
3. Write a Dockerfile that can containerize your simple application
4. Build a Docker image of your application and push it to Docker Hub. (You can create a free Docker hub
account)
5. Deploy the docker image that you have pushed to the Docker hub to your minikube cluster as a k8s
deployment and expose it to be accessed from below path http://localhost/hello-world/welcome

Additional Marks:
1. Host your source code in GitHub. (You can create a free GitHub account or use your personal account)
2. Install Jenkins on your local machine and create a Jenkins Blue ocean declarative pipeline to deploy
the application hosted on GitHub to your local minikube cluster
Note: No need to make the Jenkins pipeline to trigger automatically based on source code
changes on GitHub, manual execution of the pipeline is sufficient.
